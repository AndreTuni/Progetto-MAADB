Here's a representation of all the relationships in the Neo4j database, visualized as graphs:

---

### `HAS_TAG`
- `(Post) --HAS_TAG--> (Tag)`  
- `(Forum) --HAS_TAG--> (Tag)`  
- `(Comment) --HAS_TAG--> (Tag)`

### Explanation

- Each relationship type is shown as a separate graph.  
- **Nodes** are represented by their labels (e.g., `Person`, `Post`, `Tag`).  
- **Relationships** are represented by directed arrows (e.g., `-->`).  
- **Properties** associated with relationships are shown within curly braces (e.g., `{classYear: "value"}`).  

These graphs illustrate the connections between different node types in your Neo4j database.
